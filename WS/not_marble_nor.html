<H1>Not marble, nor the gilded monuments</H1>
<H2>-William Shakepeare&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments<BR>
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;<BR>
But you shall shine more bright in these contents<BR>
Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.<BR>
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,<BR>
And broils root out the work of masonry,<BR>
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn<BR>
The living record of your memory.<BR>
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity<BR>
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room<BR>
Even in the eyes of all posterity<BR>
That wear this world out to the ending doom.<BR>
So, till the judgment that yourself arise,<BR>
You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.<BR>
</P>
