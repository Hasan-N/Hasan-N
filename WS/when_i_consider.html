<H2>-William Shakepeare&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>
When I consider every thing that grows<BR>
Holds in perfection but a little moment,<BR>
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<BR>
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;<BR>
When I perceive that men as plants increase,<BR>
Cheered and check'd even by the self-same sky,<BR>
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<BR>
And wear their brave state out of memory;<BR>
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay<BR>
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<BR>
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,<BR>
To change your day of youth to sullied night;<BR>
And all in war with Time for love of you,<BR>
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.<BR>
