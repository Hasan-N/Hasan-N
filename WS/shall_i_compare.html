<H1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</H1>
<H2>-William Shakepeare&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?<BR>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<BR>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<BR>
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;<BR>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<BR>
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<BR>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<BR>
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;<BR>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<BR>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;<BR>
Nor shall Death Brag thou wander'st in his shade,<BR>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:<BR>
So long as men can Breathe or eyes can see,<BR>
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee<BR>
