<H1>Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye</H1>
<H2>-William Shakepeare&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye<BR>
That thou consumest thyself in single life?<BR>
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<BR>
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife:<BR>
The world will be thy widow and still weep<BR>
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<BR>
When every private widow well may keep,<BR>
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.<BR>
Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend<BR>
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it:<BR>
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,<BR>
And kept unused, the user so destroys it.<BR>
No love toward others in that bosom sits,<BR>
That on himself such murderous shame commits.<BR>
