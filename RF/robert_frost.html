Robert Frost was born on 26th March 1874. He comes in the list of one of the most influential poets in the history. His writings generally portrayed the typical rural life of the English countryside. In his poems he talks about the problems of the man who is living in the modern world and is dominated by science and technology. His poems contain complex social and philosophical themes. His mastery over the rhythm with which he composed his lines stand testimonial to his being called upon the iconic literary figure of America.  One of his most revered poems is the “Road Not Taken” which has  the lines “I took the one less travelled by; And that has made all the difference” that is often quoted by many writers. Frost was honored by four Pulitzer Prizes for poetry. He wrote more than 130 poems during his life and died on 29th January 1963 at the age of 88 at Boston, USA.
