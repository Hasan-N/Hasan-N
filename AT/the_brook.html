<P>
Hailed as one of the most popular poets of Britain, he was the Poet Laureate of Britain during the Victorian Age.  Tennyson was born on 6 August, 1809 in Somersby. He had an extensive education background and was lauded by poets like Coleridge.  <BR>
<BR>
What puts Tennyson apart from other poets is his portrayal of vivid imagery and music in his writings. He gave them an artistic touch using simple but powerful descriptions of even the most trivial happenings. This is seen in his famous poem “The Brook”, in the line “The river chatters and chatters as it flows” which instills in the reader a sense of realism achieved through verbal prowess.  He died on 6 October at an age of 83.

<H1>The Brook</H1>
<H2>-Alfred Tennson&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>
I come from haunts of coot and hern, <BR>
I make a sudden sally <BR>
And sparkle out among the fern, <BR>
To bicker down a valley. <BR>
<BR>
By thirty hills I hurry down, <BR>
Or slip between the ridges, <BR>
By twenty thorpes, a little town, <BR>
And half a hundred bridges. <BR>
<BR>
Till last by Philip's farm I flow <BR>
To join the brimming river, <BR>
For men may come and men may go, <BR>
But I go on for ever. <BR>
<BR>
I chatter over stony ways, <BR>
In little sharps and trebles, <BR>
I bubble into eddying bays, <BR>
I babble on the pebbles. <BR>
<BR>
With many a curve my banks I fret <BR>
By many a field and fallow, <BR>
And many a fairy foreland set <BR>
With willow-weed and mallow. <BR>
<BR>
I chatter, chatter, as I flow <BR>
To join the brimming river, <BR>
For men may come and men may go, <BR>
But I go on for ever. <BR>
<BR>
I wind about, and in and out, <BR>
With here a blossom sailing, <BR>
And here and there a lusty trout, <BR>
And here and there a grayling, <BR>
<BR>
And here and there a foamy flake <BR>
Upon me, as I travel <BR>
With many a silvery waterbreak <BR>
Above the golden gravel, <BR>
<BR>
And draw them all along, and flow <BR>
To join the brimming river <BR>
For men may come and men may go, <BR>
But I go on for ever. <BR>
<BR>
I steal by lawns and grassy plots, <BR>
I slide by hazel covers; <BR>
I move the sweet forget-me-nots <BR>
That grow for happy lovers. <BR>
<BR>
I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance, <BR>
Among my skimming swallows; <BR>
I make the netted sunbeam dance <BR>
Against my sandy shallows. <BR>
<BR>
I murmur under moon and stars <BR>
In brambly wildernesses; <BR>
I linger by my shingly bars; <BR>
I loiter round my cresses; <BR>
<BR>
And out again I curve and flow <BR>
To join the brimming river, <BR>
For men may come and men may go, <BR>
But I go on for ever. <BR>
