Hailed as one of the most popular poets of Britain, he was the Poet Laureate of Britain during the Victorian Age.  Tennyson was born on 6 August, 1809 in Somersby. He had an extensive education background and was lauded by poets like Coleridge.  <BR>
<BR>
What puts Tennyson apart from other poets is his portrayal of vivid imagery and music in his writings. He gave them an artistic touch using simple but powerful descriptions of even the most trivial happenings. This is seen in his famous poem “The Brook”, in the line “The river chatters and chatters as it flows” which instills in the reader a sense of realism achieved through verbal prowess.  He died on 6 October at an age of 83.

<H1>Crossing the Bar</H1>
<H2>-Alfred Tennson&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>
Sunset and evening star,<BR>
And one clear call for me!<BR>
And may there be no moaning of the bar,<BR>
When I put out to sea,<BR>
<BR>
But such a tide as moving seems asleep,<BR>
Too full for sound and foam,<BR>
When that which drew from out the boundless deep<BR>
Turns again home.<BR>
<BR>
Twilight and evening bell,<BR>
And after that the dark!<BR>
And may there be no sadness of farewell,<BR>
When I embark;<BR>
<BR>
For though from out our bourne of Time and Place<BR>
The flood may bear me far,<BR>
I hope to see my Pilot face to face<BR>
When I have crost the bar. <BR>
