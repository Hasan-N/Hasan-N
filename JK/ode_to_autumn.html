<P>
John Keats was born on October 31, 1795 in Moorgate, London to Thomas and Frances Keats. Perhaps, another of the established Romantic poets, Keats received praise for his series of odes unto nature’s various facets. His writings were smooth in emotional flow and description. 
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, only about 6 years into his passion, his health deteriorated on account of tuberculosis and he bid farewell to the world on 23 February, 1821 at a young age of 25. “Ode to the Nightingale” and “To Autumn” were some of his best works.

<H1>Ode To Autumn</H1>
<H2>-John Keats&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,<BR>
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;<BR>
Conspiring with him how to load and bless<BR>
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;<BR>
To bend with apples the mossed cottage-trees,<BR>
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;<BR>
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells<BR>
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,<BR>
And still more, later flowers for the bees,<BR>
Until they think warm days will never cease,<BR>
For Summer has o'er-brimmed their clammy cell.<BR>
<BR>
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?<BR>
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find<BR>
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,<BR>
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;<BR>
Or on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep,<BR>
Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook<BR>
Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers;<BR>
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep<BR>
Steady thy laden head across a brook;<BR>
Or by a cider-press, with patient look,<BR>
Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.<BR>
<BR>
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?<BR>
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,---<BR>
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,<BR>
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<BR>
Then in a wailful choir, the small gnats mourn<BR>
Among the river sallows, borne aloft<BR>
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;<BR>
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;<BR>
Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft<BR>
The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft,<BR>
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.<BR>
