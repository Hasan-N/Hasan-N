John Keats was born on October 31, 1795 in Moorgate, London to Thomas and Frances Keats. Perhaps, another of the established Romantic poets, Keats received praise for his series of odes unto nature’s various facets. His writings were smooth in emotional flow and description.

Unfortunately, only about 6 years into his passion, his health deteriorated on account of tuberculosis and he bid farewell to the world on 23 February, 1821 at a young age of 25. “Ode to the Nightingale” and “To Autumn” were some of his best works.

<H1>When I have fears</H1>
<H2>-John Keats&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>
When I have fears that I may cease to be <BR>
Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain,<BR>
Before high-piled books, in charactery,<BR>
Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain;<BR>
When I behold, upon the night's starr'd face,<BR>
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance,<BR>
And think that I may never live to trace<BR>
Their shadows, with the magic hand of chance;<BR>
And when I feel, fair creature of an hour,<BR>
That I shall never look upon thee more,<BR>
Never have relish in the faery power<BR>
Of unreflecting love;--then on the shore<BR>
Of the wide world I stand alone, and think<BR>
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink. <BR>
