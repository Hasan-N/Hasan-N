<P>
John Keats was born on October 31, 1795 in Moorgate, London to Thomas and Frances Keats. Perhaps, another of the established Romantic poets, Keats received praise for his series of odes unto nature’s various facets. His writings were smooth in emotional flow and description.

<BR>
Unfortunately, only about 6 years into his passion, his health deteriorated on account of tuberculosis and he bid farewell to the world on 23 February, 1821 at a young age of 25. “Ode to the Nightingale” and “To Autumn” were some of his best works.

<H1>Bright Star</H1>
<H2>-John Keats&nbsp;</H2>
<BR>
<P>
Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art-- <BR>
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night<BR>
And watching, with eternal lids apart,<BR>
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,<BR>
The moving waters at their priestlike task<BR>
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,<BR>
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask<BR>
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors--<BR>
No--yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,<BR>
Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,<BR>
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,<BR>
Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,<BR>
Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,<BR>
And so live ever--or else swoon to death<BR>
